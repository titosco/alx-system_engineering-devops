0. Simple web stack

Infrastructure Design:

Server (IP: 8.8.8.8):	
A physical or virtual machine responsible for hosting the entire web.
This server is the central hub that handles requests and manages the different components.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com):
A user tries to accesses the website by typing www.foobar.com into their browser.
The Domain Name System (DNS) then translates www.foobar.com to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

DNS Record:
The DNS record for www.foobar.com is a CNAME record, pointing to the server's IP (8.8.8.8).

Web Server (Nginx):
Nginx acts as a web server, handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
It then listens for incoming requests on port 80 and routes them to appropriate components.

Application Server:
The application server handles dynamic content and executes the website's code.
It tells the web server to process requests, often using a protocol like HTTP.

Application Files (Code Base):
The application files contain the website's code (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
These files are hosted on the server and are executed by the application server to create dynamic content.

Database (MySQL):
MySQL is used as the relational database management system.
It stores and manages the website's data, such as user information, content, and configurations.

Explanation of Roles:

Server:
The server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers (clients) over a network.

Domain Name:
A domain name is a human-readable address that translates to an IP address. It helps users access sites without remembering numerical IP addresses.

DNS Record:
The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, and the record type is a CNAME, indicating an alias for another domain.

Web Server
The web server handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and can act as a reverse proxy. Nginx, in this case, plays this role.

Application Server:
The application server executes dynamic code, interacts with databases, and generates content for the web server to deliver to users.

Database:
The database stores and manages structured data. MySQL, is a relational database used for storing website-related information.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes unavailable.

Downtime During Maintenance:
When deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, causing downtime.

Scaling Challenges:
This infrastructure may struggle to handle a sudden increase in traffic. To scale.
